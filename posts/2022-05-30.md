title: Plan for the trip

I'm planning to go *somewhere* next month. I don't tend to travel as usual, but it's a nice day to start a new thing.

The problem is, I don't have any aim for the trip. It'll be a trip for the trip. I wish if I were an anime fan, I could go to anime-related places. But I'm not.

I bought a photo book that shows `great scenery` somewhere in Japan. I'm interested in Shizuoka and Chiba right now.

## English conversation training

I have two lessons today.

Vukashin is my main tutor. He's a sincere teacher. His speaking is a bit fast, a lot of explanation for me, but I think harder is better for me.

Aliam is another tutor I like. She's friendly and I always feel relaxed when I talk with her. I want to make a warm relationship with persons I talk with. The time I speak with her should improve my ability to build rapport with someone.

Oh, it's so late now. I let myself skip ESL training and daily illustration today. Good night.
