I was struggling to come up with apparel designs. It's the reason why I skipped the diary.

I attended a meeting with the merch team. At first, I didn't notice I muted my google meet. So I said hi in the silence.
My listening skills were not good enough, but I could understand part of the conversation. So I have to improve my English skill to speak more in the meeting.

Anyway, I revealed my apparel designs, and I think they liked some of them. I felt like I was being rewarded.
