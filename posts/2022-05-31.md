I decided trip destination to Atami. I bought a guidebook for the trip. Still, there's no detailed plan yet.

I went to "the rose garden" in the city I live today. I have never been before because I'm an indoor person. But I noticed that the place is beautiful and great for taking photos to make illustration reference. I changed my mind about being an outdoor person recently.

Also, I went some clothes stores to get some ideas for designing clothes. Then I did some sketches, and I'll clean them up tomorrow.

Tomorrow I have to go to work and hand off the company website management to my colleagues.
