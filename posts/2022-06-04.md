Today I slept a lot, and I felt not productive.

I had a conversation with a new English teacher today. It was the first time to talk to her. She said she was studying for Ph.D. She looked like an intelligent person. But I felt stressed because she shook her head during the conversation, especially when my English was unclear.

But isn't it good for me to train conversation in an unfriendly mood? My next company's colleagues have a great personality and warm attitude for not skilled speakers. Of course, it's great for me, but I should improve my English to prepare for difficult situations.

But, hmm, I will choose a kinder tutor to avoid heart attacks for now.
