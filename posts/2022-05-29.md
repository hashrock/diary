Today I went to a fitness gym open 2 days ago. The reason why I started exersize today is I will start full remote work within 2 months. I feel my ability to concentrate is slightly reduced according to my age. I think plenty of exersize might make it better.

## Fitness Gym

The gym tracks member's entry by their mobile app and QR code. They said they as a gym is fully automated and they don't have any staff. Instead, they are relationally cheap. It costs about just $30 per month.

I'm suprised that there are no people in the gym when I arrived there. It seems they are not so popular for now.

And I didn't know how to use the machines in the gym. Their app have some of youtube video tutorials.

I tried an aerobike for 30min. I felt stange that I pedal a bike alone in the gym silently. There are "AI" (they said so) powered cameras to monitor the member's activity. I felt a SF flavor here. I think it'll be perfect if they produce electric power from my bike to drive the gym.

I'm interested in their security - their locker is fully open and there's no lock. Of course their entrance is locked and kept secured with QR based authentification. They don't prevent theft but they can track their members and they have record of member's activities. It's easy to sue thief after problems happen. I think services that have same kind of security policy is increasing recently.

## Draw the same thing every single day

While I was doing the execise, I watched the youtube video.

[The drawing advice that changed my life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6NsEDwHHiE)

They said "Draw the same thing every single day" is good habit to keep focused and make action before thinking. Yeah of course I can do that in "Draw the same deno every single day" here.

I feel my English vocaburary is not enough to understand the video, I'm not good at understand relaxed speaking.
