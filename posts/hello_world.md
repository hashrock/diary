Haha, This is my first post here.

I start this because my English tutor recommend to write diary in English. I'm still not good at express myself in English. Especially I can't make long sentences.

Also, I'd like to try the deno blog template. It's dogfooding :)

## Deno blog

My first impression in deno blog, I like how the system is soooo thin, clean, simple. I also very impressed how domain setting is easy in the Deno Deploy Dashboard. It also has an automated cetrification setup! I could setup [diary.hashrock.info](https://diary.hashrock.info/) within 10 min. Isn't it wonderful? Oh I want `deno task new` command ðŸ¤£

## Error

I got this error when I build on my m1 mba.

> TypeError: Cannot set properties of undefined (setting 'id')
>     at xt (https://esm.sh/v82/twind@0.16.16/deno/twind.js:3:16471)

And I got `Internal Server Error` when I try to access :8000.

But I can deploy to deno deploy this.
